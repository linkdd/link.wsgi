Introduction
============

**link.wsgi** is a fully configurable WSGI microframework. The only needed
developments are routes and eventually middlewares.

The rest is done via the configuration of the library, allowing the reuse of
the code.

Check out the source code on [Github](https://github.com/linkdd/link.wsgi).
